# Automated Software Modeling Project

This project aims to revolutionize the process of software modeling by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on interpreting modeler intentions and translating them into software models that conform to specific metamodels. Our approach encompasses the use of semantic analysis and automated prompt creation to interface effectively with LLMs.



## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:


- `data`: Includes   data-related resources used by the project; json files that categorize modeling formalisms.
- `img`: Contains images and graphical resources, likely used for documentation or model visualization.
- `src`: The source directory where the project's main codebase resides.

## Implementation

Our pipeline translates modeling formalisms and user intentions into prompts that LLMs can comprehend and act upon. It incorporates:

- A classification of design modeling formalisms.
- A systematic approach for prompt generation.
- Defined semantic encoding principles to guide the LLM.
- An automated workflow to facilitate model completion.
- Novel evaluation metrics tailored for assessing software modeling efficacy.

## Running Examples

We provide two examples to demonstrate our methodology's application:

1. `Class Diagram`: A structural representation of the system showcasing static elements such as classes, attributes, and relationships.

2. `Activity Diagram`: A behavioral model capturing dynamic workflows and actions within the system.

Each example is accompanied by an iterative refinement process, reflecting the synergy between user intentions, metamodel adherence, and the generative capabilities of LLMs.

## Usage

To utilize our software modeling pipeline, follow these simple steps:

### Jupyter Notebook
(Python3 is used here)
- Navigate to the `src` directory where the Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`) is located.
- The notebook contains well-commented cells that guide you through the process of generating software models. Run each cell sequentially to see the methodology in action.
- Make sure to provide the specific diagram examples as input where indicated in the notebook.
